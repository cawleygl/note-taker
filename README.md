# Note-Taker

## Description of Application
This application allows user to take notes and save them online using Node.js and Express web framework. Additionally, I utilized Nodemon to test the server during development. I was provided a non-functional front end for the application, and built and connected the back end to provide functionality with Node and Express. It is deployed live on Heroku's cloud application platform. Users can enter a note title and body, and click on the save icon in the upper-right hand corner to save their current note. Notes appear in a list to the left of the text area, where users can click on notes in the list to view them again, and click the note's corresponding delete icon to delete it.
